    ==============================================================
    
    Team: Team 3
    Sample Size: 41
    
    1. Sample Size Calculation:
       - Calculated sample size (n): 41
       - Used formula: n0 = (z * σ / E)^2 with finite population correction
       - Parameters: z=1.96 (95% CI), σ=10, E=3, N=979
    
    2. Sampling Method:
       - Used simple random sampling
       - Sample size: 41 records
    
    3. Descriptive Statistics:
       - Sample Mean (marks): 76.76
       - Sample Standard Deviation: 8.77
       - Population Mean: 77.38
       - Population Standard Deviation: 9.86
    
    4. Sampling Distribution:
       - Mean of sampling distribution: 77.44
       - Standard Error (SE): 1.53
       - Expected SE (σ/√n): 1.54
    
    5. Hypothesis Testing:
       - Null Hypothesis (H0): μ = 77.38
       - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 77.38
       - At 5% significance: Fail to reject H0
       - At 1% significance: Fail to reject H0
    
    6. Confidence Intervals:
           - 90% CI: (74.50, 79.01) ±2.25
       - 95% CI: (74.07, 79.44) ±2.68
       - 99% CI: (73.23, 80.28) ±3.53

    7. Correlation Analysis:
       - Pearson Correlation Coefficient: 0.0484
       - p-value: 0.7636
       - Interpretation: Not significant
    
    8. Regression Analysis:
       a. Marks on Study Hours:
          - Equation: Marks = 74.91 + 0.14 * Study_Hours
          - R-squared: 0.0023
       
       b. Study Hours on Marks:
          - Equation: Study_Hours = 12.02 + 0.02 * Marks
    
    9. Prediction Example:
       - For 15 study hours: Predicted marks = 77.0
    
    10. Significance Tests:
        - Correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero
        - Regression slope is not significantly different from zero
